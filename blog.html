        <h2>5 Tips for Getting Started with Web Development</h2>
        <p>
            Web development is a dynamic field with endless possibilities. Begin your journey by mastering the foundational technologies: 
            HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. 
            Once comfortable, explore frameworks like React or Angular to build modern web applications.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Practice building small projects, like a portfolio or a to-do list, to apply your knowledge and showcase your skills!</p>

        <h2>How I Built My Restaurant Management System</h2>
        <p>
            The Restaurant Management System was one of my most ambitious projects. Using C++, I implemented features for 
            seamless online ordering, a user-friendly table reservation system, and robust customer feedback integration. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The challenge lay in creating a dynamic menu system and ensuring data persistence. Through this project, I learned 
            valuable lessons in modular programming and error handling.

        <h2>Why Problem-Solving is Essential for Programmers</h2>
        <p>
            Programming is like solving a puzzle. Each problem you face builds your analytical and critical thinking skills. 
            Start by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and tackling them systematically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participate in coding challenges on platforms like HackerRank or LeetCode to hone your skills. Remember, problem-solving isn't just about algorithmsâ€”it's about understanding the requirements and designing efficient solutions.
